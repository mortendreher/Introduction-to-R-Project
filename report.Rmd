# Introduction

## Liver cancer

### Overview

The liver is the central metabolism organ of the human body.
It is located in the upper right side of the body, protected by the lower ribs.<br>
With a weight of approximately 1500 grams, it is the largest gland of the body.  
Besides metabolism, the liver is also responsible for producing a variety of coagulation factors and hormones.<br>
The organ is also essential for removing external substances like alcohol and medications from the blood stream. 
For 2020, the WHO estimated the number of new cases of liver cancer (ICD C22) to be 905 677 (CI:[884695-927157]).  
According to the WHO, liver cancer caused 830 000 deaths worldwide in 2020, a number only exceeded by lung cancer (1.8 million deaths worldwide) and colorectal cancer (935 000 deaths worldwide).

### Epidemiology

In most sources, liver cancer prevalence, incidence and mortality for men is about 2-3 times as high as it is for women.<br>
WHO data estimates that in 2020, 632 000 men and 273 000 women were diagnosed with liver cancer and that in the same year, 578 000 men and 253 000 women in association with liver cancer. For men, liver cancer mortality is only surpassed by lung cancer mortality.<br>
For women on the other hand, liver cancer only takes sixth place in terms of total deaths, with sex-specific tumours like breast and uterus cancer accounting for more deaths.<br>
For Germany, the most recent data available describes new cases and mortality in 2017. In this year, 6040 men and 2903 women were diagnosed with liver cancer and 5213 men and 2697 women died in association with liver cancer.<br>

### Risk factors 

Chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection greatly increase the risk of developing liver cancer.<br>
Cirrhosis, an irreversible process in which healthy liver tissue is replaced by scar tissue, thus losing its functions, is also a prominent risk factor for liver cancer.<br>
Excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are also associated with an increased risk for liver cancer.

### Symptoms

There are multiple symptoms, but the one that displays the liver function most is the so called jaundice, also known as Icterus, where your skin and especially your eyes turn yellow. <br>
Other symptoms as a loss of appetite, feeling generally unwell as well as having a loss of energy and tireness are widely considered as symptoms of cancer of any type.

### Diagnosis

The diagnostic process is the same as for most cancer types. Typically there are blood tests to look for tumour markers as well as a biopsy, in that case of liver cells.<br>
Other possible diagnostic options are PET scans, CTA or MRI scans.

### Treatment

* Surgery
* Ablation
* Embolization Therapy
* Radiation Therapy
* Targeted Drug Therapy
* Immunotherapy
* Chemotheraphy

### Prevention

As HBV and HCV infections are major risk factors for the development of liver cancer, taking precautions against these viruses can help prevent liver cancer.<br>
Protection against hepatitis B can be obtained by a vaccine which is recommended for children and adults at risk in many countries including Germany, the US and the UK.<br>
Hepatitis C is transmitted parenterally and sexually, therefore prevention includes only using clean, disinfected needles and syringes as well as being aware of the health status of sexual partners.<br>
In the case that an infection with HBV or HCV could not be prevented, treatments reducing liver cancer risk are available.<br>
In a 2007 meta-analysis, increased coffee consumption was found to be associated to a lower risk of liver cancer.<br>
Reducing alcohol consumption and keeping a healthy weight can also help reduce liver cancer risk.

# Our plan

## Columns to add

The first step was to gather important information that we needed to adjust the dataset for liver cancer. As weight and height were already given, we decided to calculate the BMI.
For the variable smoking, which we plan to rename to smoker , we wanted to be able to have the numbers of cigarettes per day. To better quantify the smoking behaviour , we thought of adding and calculating the variable, packyears.
Another important risk factor that has been linked to an increased chance in getting liver cancer, is alcohol abuse. To have the ability to measure the alcohol consumption, we planned to add the  variable, alcohol consumption  in mg.
A leading risk factor is chronic carriage of hepatitis B (HBV), or hepatitis C (HCV) . For these two we planned to add two dichotomous variables. Another  dichotomous variable we wanted to add was diabetes. 
For the missing values for cholesterol, we thought of imputating the data with either KNN or BMI-grouped mean .
To enhance the dataset, we decided to round multiple variables, such as cholesterol, weight and height. Generally, weight appears with one rounded decimal point and since the height was given in centimetres, we did not need the digits.
After a closer look at the data, we realized that two variables, smoking and gender, were identical. This would mean, that we have only women that are smokers and non-smoking men. To get a better variation, our idea was to modify one of the variables.
We also wanted to rename Smoking to smoker and gender to sex.

## Graphs and tables
We decided to add multiple graphs to our Shiny App. To show the relationship between two numerical variables, we chose a scatter plot. The idea was that the user will be able to define variables for x and y axis and can specify a grouping variable.
Furthermore, we wanted to add a box plot for a continuous variable, that the user can specify and group it by a categorical variable.
To summarize discrete or continuous data, we wanted to implement a histogram. Here, as well, the user should be able to choose a variable.
A last graph that we wanted to add was a pie chart, to be able to show percentage from our data.

Lastly for the continuous(stetige) variables, we decided to create a table that shows the important statistical parameters such as minimum, quartiles, mean and maximum.
For variables that are normal distributed, we planned to have a table where a user can determine confidence intervals with a specific alpha by their choice.
Our next step was going to be, to think about confounding.


# Dataset manipulation

This section concerns itself with how our team adapted the _cancer_data.csv_ file for our specific needs and how we addressed missing values.

## General changes

Metric variables with digits were rounded to decimal points depending on their values. As height was given in centimeters, we rounded it to full integers. Weight, given in kilograms, was rounded to one decimal point. Cholesterol values were rounded to two digits.  
Gender was renamed to sex and smoking was renamed to smoker.

## Added variables

To adjust the dataset for liver cancer, we added a few variables.  
As both patient height and weight were available, we computed Body Mass Index (BMI) for all patients with one decimal point.
When looking at smoking behaviour, packyears is a more powerful measure than the given dichotomous variable indicating whether or not a person is currently smoking. Packyears are calculated as the product of years that a person has been smoking for and the number of cigarette packs they smoke each day. I.e. a person smoking one pack of cigarettes a day for 5 years would have 5 packyears. To compute packyears, we added a variable _cigs_per_day_ describing how many (if any) cigarettes patients smoked each day. This variable can only be realistically measured by asking the patient about it. In such surveys, humans tend to round numbers, which is why we decided that the cigarettes per day variable should only contain uniformly randomly generated multiples of ten ranging from 0 (for non-smokers) to 60. 
With 20 cigarettes per pack, this means that we have a maximum of 3 packs per day smoked.  
The more difficult part was modeling how long patients had been smoking for. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 9 out of 10 smoking adults first tried smoking by age 18 and 99% first tried smoking by age 26.  
Therefore, we determined that all smoking patients started between ages 16 and 26 or age 16 and the smallest age observed in our study, should it be smaller than 26. The smallest age observed in the data coincided to be precisely 26. In this interval, uniformly random values were generated.  
Packyears were then calculated as: 
$$
packyears=\frac{cigs\_per\_day}{20} \cdot (age-age_{started})
$$
Another variable we considered to be closely related to liver cancer was alcohol consumption. Alcohol abuse can lead to fatty liver disease or liver cirrhosis and thus increase risk for liver cancer. To generate these values, we decided to use a positively skewed distribution in order to simulate rather low alcohol consumption for most patients while still allowing for outliers with high alcohol consumption.
We multiplied random values of a chi-squared distribution with 4 degrees of freedom by 25 to generate values for alcohol consumption.  
Compared to the general population, the generated alcohol consumption values were very high, however we justified these high values by the fact that our sample consists exclusively of patients with liver cancer, a disease for which excessive alcohol consumption is a major risk factor.  
Alcohol consumption in grams per day was saved with the precision of one decimal point.  
The distribution used to simulate alcohol consumption in grams per day:

![](img/alc_dist.png){width=50%}

As advanced stages of liver cancer are associated with icterus, a yellowish pigmentation of the skin caused by an increase in blood bilirubin levels, we also included bilirubin in our dataset. 
We decided to model bilirubin in dependency of other variables in the dataset, namely cholesterol, tumour size, alcohol consumption and packyears as we saw those variables indicative of liver function. The bilirubin variable in our dataset has two digits.


## Missing values 

In the original data, three cholesterol observations were missing. In order to find accurate replacements, we compared results of BMI-grouped means and kNN imputation.

### BMI-grouped means

For this approach, we added a new variable describing BMI groups. Observations were assigned to one of four classes based on their BMI as follows: 

BMI class | BMI
-- | -- 
1 | $BMI <22$
2 | $22\leq BMI <24$
3 | $24\leq BMI < 26$
4 | $BMI \geq 26$

For observations with missing cholesterol values, we determined their BMI group and imputed the arithmetic mean for cholesterol in that group (over all non-missing observations).
The motivation behind this was that patients with similar BMIs were assumed to have similar cholesterol values as well.  
However, this approach was discarded later on as BMI groups were large and we feared that mean imputation would be inaccurate and would underestimate true variance for such large group sizes. 

### kNN imputation

As our concerns with the accuracy of the aforementioned BMI-grouped means approach grew, we started looking for alternative imputation methods based on fewer observations. Our goal was to replace missing values by using similar observations in the hope that they would also be similar for cholesterol.
A very common and effective way to replace missing data based on similar observations is the kNN (k-nearest neighbours) method.  
This algorithm determines the _k_ closest entries to an observation with missing values and imputes the mean of those nearest neighbours.  
When it comes to choosing _k_, there is no universally optimal solution. Different values for _k_ might be optimal for different datasets.
In more sophisticated imputations, the existing data can be used to calculate the optimal value for _k_. However, as data imputation was not the main focus of this project, we simply chose _k_ so that neighbour values were sufficiently similar. Comparing standard deviations of cholesterol for _k_=3,5,7,9 showed that values were most similar for _k_=3, so this was chosen as the number of neighbours to be considered.  
For our kNN approach, we decided that as few as possible variables should be used and that those variables should have a substantial association to cholesterol as to not reduce model accuracy due to noise in the data. Furthermore, we realised that implementing weighting of variables could prove useful.  
The variables we used to find nearest neighbours for cholesterol were:

 * sex (weight=0.25): distributions of cholesterol differed between sexes
 * age (weight=1): a linear association between age and cholesterol was found in the data
 * bmi (weight=1.25): the data showed an association between bmi and cholesterol. bmi was assigned additional weight as higher bmi is associated with higher levels of cholesterol in literature
 * size (weight=1): a linear association between size and cholesterol was present in the data

Our implementation of the kNN algorithm was split into two functions, one computing distances and a second one returning the _k_ nearest neighbours based on the distances calculated using the first function. 

```{r knn, eval=FALSE}
#' Compute distances from one node in a data frame to all other nodes
#' @param df Data frame
#' @param id Row number of the reference node
#' @param vars A vector specifying variables to be considered (by columns)
#' @param weights A vector specifying weights for the variables
#' @return The distances of specified node to all other nodes
#' @examples
#' distances(df, id=3, vars=c(1,2,3), weights=c(1.25, 2, 1.5))

distances <- function(df, id, vars, weights=rep.int(1,length(vars))) {
  distance_to_id <- numeric(length(df[,1]))
  for(v in vars) {
    for(i in (1:length(distance_to_id))) {
        rng <- range(df[,v])
        distance_to_id[i] = distance_to_id[i] + 
          (abs(df[i,v]-df[id,v])/(rng[2]-rng[1]))*weights[which(vars==v)]
    }
  }
  return(distance_to_id)
}

#' Return IDs of k nearest neighbours for a specified node
#' @param df Data frame
#' @param id Row number of the reference node
#' @param vars A vector specifying variables to be considered (by columns)
#' @param k Number of nearest neighbours to be found
#' @param weights A vector specifying weights for the variables
#' @examples 
#' knn(df, id=3, vars=c(1,2,3), k=3, weights=c(1.25, 2, 1.5))
knn <- function(df, id, vars, k, weights=rep.int(1,length(vars))) {
  distances_to_id <- distances(df, id, vars, weights)
  df_with_distances <- data.frame(cbind(df, distances_to_id), ordered_id=(1:length(distances_to_id)))
  df_with_distances <- filter(df_with_distances, ordered_id !=id)
  df_with_distances <- arrange(df_with_distances, df_with_distances$distances_to_id)
  return(df_with_distances$ordered_id[1:k])
}
```

Imputed values computed from our kNN method are listed below:

ID of NA | Chol neighbour 1 (distance) | Chol neighbour 2 (distance) | Chol neighbour 3 (distance) | 3NN-mean (=imputed value)
--        | --                            | --                        | --                            |-- 
50 | 197.79 (0) | 201.33 (0.048) | 201.03 (0.048) | __200.05__ 
72 | 148.67 (0.184) | 157.83 (0.49) | 158.3 (0.525) | __154.93__ 
182 | 231.35 (0) | 227.75 (0.048) | 228.72 (0.083) | __229.27__ 


To further evaluate our kNN algorithm, we compared it against naive mean imputation on a second dataset. This dataset consisted of 1000 generated observations of patients with variables age, sex, height, weight and blood pressure. Values were generated with weak associations between different variables, i.e. blood pressure being higher for patients with larger values for height or weight.
Roughly 20% of blood pressure values were removed and imputed with the two methods to be compared.
In two separate iterations, both imputation methods were used to predict generated MCAR (missing completely at random) and MNAR (missing not at random) values. Accuracy was evaluated using the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) between predicted and actual values saved in a backup vector. 
For both MCAR and MNAR values, our kNN algorithm produced smaller RMSE (1.43 and 1.72 respectively) than naive mean imputation (2.38 and 3.22 respectively). Visually comparing kNN predictions and naive mean predictions to the actual values showed that kNN imputation was also fairly accurate for high and low values while naive mean imputation showed high discrepancy for very high and very low values.  

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
include_graphics(path=c("img/knnMCAR.png", "img/meanMCAR.png"))
include_graphics(path=c("img/knnMNAR.png", "img/meanMNAR.png"))
```

## Simulations

In order to implement Survival Analysis, we decided to simulate specific variables for 11 additional points in time, resulting in 12 total values with steps being interpreted as months. Modeled variables included patient weight, BMI, tumour size and bilirubin. As cancer patients tend to lose weight over time, weight (and therefore BMI) were modeled to slightly decrease (normal distribution with $\mu =-0.6$ and $\sigma=0.5$ kg) with each month. 
For tumour size, we decided that both an increase and decrease over time should be possible with a growing tumour being more likely. Tumour size was modeled to be size of the previous month plus a uniformly randomly generated value between -0.01 and 0.05. 
Bilirubin was updated based on its previous values as well as tumour size for the patient, with tumour growth also implying an increase in bilirubin level.
Based on these simulations, we computed mortality probabilities for each patient and month. Mortality probability increased with:

 * high age
 * large tumour size
 * high bilirubin levels
 * high alcohol consumption
 * high number of packyears
 * diabetes
 
In addition, as it is common in longitudinal studies for patients to drop out of the study, either due to withdrawal or medical reasons, we calculated a censorship probability for each patient and month. We decided that patients with large tumour size, high BMI or high bilirubin levels should be more likely to be censored, as these patients may potentially need to undergo a different treatment.  
Afterwards, we used the mortality and censorship probabilities to generate a dataset containing information about whether patients are alive, dead or censored for each month. Once a patient had either died or been censored, all of the remaining months were also marked as dead or censored, respectively. 
After applying our approach, we ended up with 166 alive, 76 dead and 58 censored patients in month 12, values that we deemed acceptable for liver cancer.

# Individual Contributions

## Morten Dreher

With only few exceptions towards the end of the project, the majority of the project was programmed with all team members being present and giving input. 
I was responsible for setting up and maintaining our team's Git repository.
In the final stages of the project, I reworked our risk table using the gt package, fixed some aspects of our Kaplan-Meier-curve and added labels to our data frame columns using the papeR package.
Other minor changes included fixing plot labels, correcting BMI computation and cleaning of scripts.

## Melita Coneva
To make the Shiny App more pleasant to look at, I could get creative and was responsible for the design. This included changing the theme for the navbarPage and the graphs, adding icons to the TabPanels and minor colour changes in our graphs.
